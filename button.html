I decided to use my MacBook to make an audio book version of the Angular-Fundamentals-(v6.1.10)-Docs.  I copy pasted them into Libre Office first before running Apple’s “convert to speech” function on it. I actually had to edit them quite a bit before I could convert them to speech.  However,  since I already had these Docs in the word processor I thought I would export them as a PDF. So, now I can Share them in case someone working offline might need them.
